### Useful resources

- [DOMPurify Documentation](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) - This library helped me sanitize user inputs effectively.
- [Sortable.js Documentation](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - This library made drag-and-drop functionality easy to implement.
- [Notyf Documentation](https://github.com/caroso1222/notyf) - I used Notyf for simple and clean notifications, and I recommend it to others looking for easy-to-implement notification systems.
